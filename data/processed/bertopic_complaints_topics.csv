For background, this is my 4th round with Esther and Zuleika. When I first played them they were attracted to each other and Grim, but seemed more set on each other long-term, both rolling the want to get married in round 2. In their 3rd round I wanted them to have a child so kept resetting for the ""bad"" outcome from the Wishing Well, that being their ghost daughter Skye. \n\n  \nI loaded in for round 4 today and saw Zuleika had the want to have a child, so I thought it\'d just check with MCCC to see if it\'s possible as ghosts and...well. I\'m truly baffled. I mean I\'m not complaining, but I\'m beyond confused here. As you can see there\'s no options to progress, change or end the pregnancy. I have any MCCC and neighbourhood stories settings that could have done this switched off. I do play with WW so that seems like the only other culprit, but Grim has always been very careful in that regard... \n\n  \nI plan on reviving Skye at some point so she can grow up and keep up with her friends while they go through high school, and had considered doing the same with Zuleika so she could have that baby. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m very happy for them, just very, ***very*** confused!!', ""Something you wish the Sims 4 would DELETE:\nNow, just want to talk about the *small* things, not gameplay, paywall, bugs, etc.😂 \n\nHere's mine:\n\nThe DAMN Thanksgiving Gnomes. Why don't they go away after the holiday is over? Why do they spread seeds everywhere? Why are you REQUIRED for the holiday to interact with them just for them to dump seeds everywhere or break my shit? Why do I feel so guilty about killing them? \nI like holidays, so don't want to disable them but- those damn Gnomes. \n\nThe trellis. It becomes the main entrance of the house and nothing pisses me off more than my Sim being outside, needing to pee, using the trellis to go upstairs and walk by 3 toilets to go pee downstairs right next to the actual front door. UGH. I never get the sneak out option in High School Years so now it's just useless AND annoying. Could I delete this? Yes, but one day I'm going to get the damn pop up. \n\nHomework books. I actually didn't think of this one till someone mentioned old Sims you'd just click the bookshelf to do your homework, omg I'd die for that for Sims 4, and have the option to do homework on the computer would be convenient. \n\nHaving a grill solely because of those damn potions. Omfg. I could built a lot with the amount of potions that accumulate when I'm not paying attention to my yard. \n\nGHOSTS BREAKING MY SHIT. \n\nI'll think of more I'm sure. What's yours? \n\n*my apologies for the gnome debate.. but after all your comments, I still hate them* \n-I don't need the simoleons from them. It is too easy to make simoleons in the game for me to care about selling them, and it still makes me feel guilty for 'killing' them. \n-I have enough produce to last till my Sims great great grandchildren. My garden is the tit's. The 100+ apples in my Sims inventory would make doctors extinct. "", 'Elders are NOT fun- what can be done to fix that?:\nLet\'s get real for a second. I never play Elders. When I have a Sim reach adulthood, I play them for a while but as soon as they get close to ageing up, I shelve them and never touch them again.\n\nWhy? Because Elders are not fun.\n\nThey don\'t have age-appropriate hairstyles, clothes or hobbies, and if you try to make them Woohoo or exercise, there\'s a very real chance they might drop dead then and there, so their romantic relationships suffer as a result.\n\nSo, now that I\'ve talked about why I DON\'T play Elders, let\'s talk about what would make me WANT TO.\n\n* **Knitting!** My grandmother taught my sister and cousins how to knit as children, and now they\'re well into their 30s and they still do it to this day. Knitting would be a great way to unlock new cold-weather outfits since there\'s a startling lack of those. Scarves, mittens, sweaters, coats, and layered combinations of all of the above, there\'s so much potential here. And since cold-weather outfits are part of the base game, this content need not be exclusive to Seasons!\n* **Babysitting!** Let\'s face it, we *could* hire a Nanny, but every new mother I know calls on her own mother for help looking after the wee ones. Why not give us the opportunity to call our Sims\' parents over instead of hiring a Nanny?\n* **New Walk Styles!** Walking sticks, rollators... you get the idea.\n* **Grandparent-Grandchild Interactions:** ""You know, back in *my day...*"" that sort of thing. Let\'s have our Elders impart their knowledge onto their grandkids- this could be as simple as giving a Child or Teen Sims a head-start on a skill that the Elder has a high level in, or inspiring the grandkid to have a high-scoring Whim to join the same career as their grandparent.\n* **Family Recipes!** When a Sim reaches Adulthood, they might gain the ability to craft a Family Recipe. And, once they\'re an Elder, they could then pass on that recipe to younger family members, who can then pass it down to their descendants. Lumpy Mashed Potatoes, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies, Grandma\'s Comfort Soup (from TS2), you know, proper, homestyle cooking, just like Grandma used to make!\n* **New Traits!** Sims who age up from Teen to Young Adult get bonus Traits in Parenthood, but I\'d like to see something similar happen in the transition from Adult to Elder, perhaps as a consequence of reaching max level in a Career, or seeing your children grow up well. These could range from the negative- ""Forgetful"" might make Sims refresh their Whims at a more frequent rate (no need to make it full-on Dementia after all!), to the positive- ""Retirement Fund"" might allow Elder Sims to gain some bonus Simoleons every few days to live out their twilight years without needing to work themselves into an early grave.\n\nThat\'s all I\'ve got for the time being, feel free to add your own suggestions!']"

Only when I turned off the script mods (but left the CC) did it work, so I have no idea what's making it crash.\n\nA friend recommended uninstalling and re-installing, but I'm way too scared about losing my stuff to do it and the game's way too boring without the mods I'm used to. So is there a way to fix this (possibly without having to uninstall the whole thing) or should I just wait it out?\n\nUPDATE: I went and looked through each one of my mods, deleting the broken ones, updating the whole thing and it is STILL broken so I think my game is cursed yall"", ""My builds keep getting deleted:\nSo my game broke after the update because I have a ton of CC and mods. Can't load into a household with mods on, turned them off, loading in works fine. Mod problem. Cool, annoying but understandable.\n\nSince I couldn't play in the saves I normally do, I decided to do some building because that worked either way. But when I load back into the game, in manage worlds it's there just how I left it. But if I try to go onto the lot it reverts it back to how it originally was (house I bulldozed, empty lot, etc.) This happened twice. I turned off mods, tried again, it happened again. My sibling also had this issue. We both have mods.

So it still could be mods I guess, I don't know. I guess I'll try removing the folder.\n\nI'm just pissed off rn. I want to play, but now it's not even letting me build.

I'm pretty new to reddit so this has probably been posted before.\n\nI've been playing Sims 4 with mods for a long time now and I've always been able to play the game with mods with very little to no issue. But for some reason, after installing the new Wicked Perversions update, I can't play the game in live mode anymore. When I load up my save file, it opens up on the Worlds Map and whenever I try to play my household (or even any household), I just get rerouted back to the Worlds Map again.\n\nI've tried deleting Wicked Perversions and even doing the 50/50 method to check which of my mods are causing the error, but neither has worked. I've also tried deleting cache files (GameVersion.txt, Options.ini, localthumbcache.package, and Resource.cfg in the mods folder) since I saw a similar post that had this as the solution. \n\nSo far, the only thing that seems to work was disabling script mods (but not cc). I was able to play in live mode and load my household after this, but obviously most of my mods don't really work anymore.\n\nI'm open to trying anything at this point, so if any of you have any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.""]"

4,94,4_sims_the_of_that,Sims 5 Critiques & Franchise Uncertainty,"['sims', 'the', 'of', 'that', 'game', 'to', 'be', 'for', 'in', 'and']","['I don’t want sims 5, i want a sims 2 remake. :\nSims 2 was really made with love, attention to details, and a good level of difficulty. everything is important and everything matters. wants and fears, good and bad events, needs, everything actually affect the sims.\nSims 3 lacks this attention to details, but they compromised and put every efforts into the open world. but we were waiting for a balance between a great open world and attention to details, and realism while keeping the sims original signature, aesthetic, and universe. \n\nwhen sims 4 came out in 2014, that’s what I was waiting for. I was waiting for a perfect remake of sims 2 with open world like sims 3, and many other features, and graphics. an immersive gameplay where everything matters, everything is important, that they are not just puppets. \n\ninstead, we got bland, tasteless, lifeless, even useless sims 4. \nugly graphics even for the time, a bland gameplay, and no real purpose. everything is boring. \nnothing really matters. the emotions, which was announced as a big feature, does not affect a lot the gameplay. \nonly 3 traits that does not affects the gameplays either, and a life goal/ambition system that is absolutely bland compared to the sims 2 and 3.\nthey add more and more and more features with the 500 packs that they sell u for 40€, that are as useless and bland. sims are just useless puppets that have no real purpose. which is very sad, for a life simulator. \n\nwe were announced Project rene, but it’s been 1 year since we had any updates and news about this game. i’m losing hope. \n\nthe sims franchise will die if they don’t do anything. \n\n what do you think? do you agree? ', 'Soooo, given that EA has confirmed we’re not getting the Sims 5… what now for the series?:\nSo this was something I was thinking about, as it stands, EA obv isn\'t planning a direct successor to the Sims 4, instead basically focusing on spin offs (most of which seem to be mobile games, which yes I get are very profitable but don\'t really fill the same niche as the traditional Sims games at all IMO). And so with this news, I was thinking, where does that leave the Sims 4, and the Sims generally?\n\nNow obviously, the Sims isn’t quite in the position it used to be in, where it was the only game like it on the market, so the user just kinda had to put up with whatever. There are various competitors popping up which COULD potentially knock the Sims off its throne, or at least take a decent market share away from the brand!\n\nI mean, in my opinion, there are basically a few things the Sims 4 could do, they could either go a “ship of thesis” route where most of the games internals are repaired and modernised (leaving no-very little remnants of the original game, hense the analogy), or they could keep things mostly as they are (basically an 11 year old game held together by duct tape and hope) and hope for the best.\n\nOn one hand, IF they were to choose to go the “ship of thesis” route, it\'d be quite a bit of work, given they\'d effectively be rewriting very large portions of the game (arguably effectively creating a new game). However, in the long term, it might just be what’s best for both the health of the game (and therefore EA’s profits) and the playerbase (who EA are heavily reliant on). \n\nOriginally, the Sims 4 was planned to be an always-online multiplayer-ish game, but when SimCity (2013) failed as hard as it did, EA pivoted and hastily retooled the game into a single-player game, which, of course, caused a bunch of issues. And while SOME of these issues have been remedied over the years, many are still present, and NGL, it\'s just hard to build your supposedly definitive Sims game on such rocky foundations. \n\nRewriting large parts of the game could solve this; they\'d be replacing all the problematic, hacky parts of the code base, and they could even rewrite the game into something based on what EA specifically wants it to be NOW, a very long-term Sims base game to sell DLC from, optimised for modern hardware. \n\nWho knows, with such rewrites, EA may finally be able to implement some features that the fanbase has been asking for but which were previously impossible, such as greater modding capabilities (maybe even stuff like Create-a-World), and they could EVEN try to implement arguably the biggest selling point one of their main competitors has over them, an open world (though that could be a slight reach haha). \n\nSo while yes, it would be a lot of work for EA to rewrite and optimise the Sims 4 for modern systems (perhaps such a rewrite could see the game rebranded to just simply ""the Sims""), doing so could potentially allow EA to ensure that their competiton are unable to seriously challenge them in the life sim market.\n\nOn the other hand, EA could simply keep doing what they are doing now, continuing to release new DLCs and neglecting areas of the game in need of optimisation and bugfixes. By doing this, they\'d largely be relying on brand loyalty and stuff like influencer advertising. However... I kinda feel like... I mean, influencer advertising isn\'t SUPER expensive, and companies like Krafton can also afford to promote their game this way. So really, they\'re kinda just relying on the brand loyalty people have for the Sims, and hoping that the other competitors don\'t get too popular. \n\nI feel that for EA, this is kinda a risky strategy. It MIGHT work; the other main competitors may simply fail to gain significant traction, and the Sims gets to maintain its profitable position at the top without EA having to expend the effort to fix the game. If that happens, EA wins! HOWEVER, if either one of the new Sims competitors ends up getting good, good enough to start taking customers away from the Sims, then EA and Maxis could face a situation similar to that of Cities: Skylines and SimCity, which would probably be disastrous for EA, given how important the Sims brand is for them.\n\nBut yeah, those were just my silly thoughts, obviously, I\'m just kinda spitballing here, I\'d love to hear your thoughts in the comments though, thanks a bunch for reading!', 'I’m pissed off, and now I have a list of demands for the next Sims game:\nDisclaimer: this post is slightly tongue-in-cheek, but does convey my thoughts on what I think should be prioritized for The Sims 5, assuming it gets made. Also, this post will be _laden_ with profanity - you’ve been warned\n\nSomething that has remained a constant throughout the Sims series is that Sims do all kinds of stupid shit to _piss you off_. The Sims 4 is better about this in some regards, but worse in others. This all became very clear to me during a bit of a marathon Sims 4 session yesterday, playing a family that consisted of two married sims and their three pairs of twins, where I became more and more frustrated throughout the day. Apologies to my neighbors, who probably now think I’m verbally abusing a mute person who lives with me as they sporadically hear me scream things like “NO! Put down the fucking bowl NOW and go to the fucking bathroom, you stupid cunt!”\n\nAs a result, I now have an official list of demands for Sims 5. It doesn’t include cars, open world, or any of that crap. It simply includes ways for sims to not piss me off so fucking much.\n\nBtw, this is focused on ways the Sims 4 pisses me off, but before you go smugly saying “tHiS iS wHy I wEnT bAcK 2 tHe SiMs 3”, just know that I will _glady_ spell out the fucking _LITANY_ of ways that The Sims 3 used to piss me off. Try me, stans. 🤣\n\nWithout further ado, my list of demands for a future Sims game:\n\n1. If I tell you to do something, do it ***NOW!!!*** Not 5 sim minutes from now. Not after you’re done with the chat animation. NOW!! Fucking NOW NOW NOW. I know it’s really important to _you_ that you finish your next bite of cereal, but it’s more important to _ME_ that you not ***SHIT YOURSELF***. In other words, sims should be more responsive and stop an activity immediately if the player has cancelled that action. It’s not unrealistic to do - in real life it’s a thing you can do to say “Hold that thought, Bob, I need to go to the bathroom before I shit myself.” It’s not rude, it’s just good manners to not shit yourself.\n2. Stop being so ***GOD DAMN DUMB***. We need better AI. It doesn’t have to be perfect - I’m totally fine with my stupid sims passing out because they didn’t get enough sleep. What I can’t fucking stand is when they’re so irredeemably stupid that it results in what I’m lovingly referring to as “Nightmare morning”. It’s Saturday morning, the last pair of twins is ready to age up. So mom baked them a birthday cake. This takes _hours_ because all the teenagers in the house are all trying to cook ***for some fucking reason*** despite that there are already two excellent-quality meals ready for them on the counter, and so mom can’t reach the oven to finish the cake. Cue several minutes of all my sims playing hot potato with this bowl of cake dough as I try to cancel their actions one by one. This is already fucking infuriating, but then one of them decides to try to grill something, but they have no cooking skill so they set the grill on fire, and now everyone stops what they’re doing to look at the fire, which is on the other side of the fucking lot. Bright side, now the oven is clear, so mom can ***finally finish baking the fucking cake***. Finally, we get some candles on that bad boy, and mom’s close to her birthday, so I decide to kill three birthdays with one cake. Mom blows out the candles, but then instead of aging up, _she teleports outside of the house_. Okay let’s try again. Same thing. I do reset sim, and this time it works. I proceed to do “reset sim” on each of the twins before having them blow out the candles, though it takes a while, because they have both wandered off to the edge of the lot which is a big deal because it’s one of those huge Windenburg lots. In summary, better AI for autonomy. The autonomy is better than in previous games but it’s still really bad.\n3. Faster eating. Faster shitting. Faster showering. I’m so fucking sick of this shit, I don’t know why we’re all so okay with it taking a fucking month for a sim to eat a fucking bowl of cereal, sitting there like a grinning little cunt staring at the fucking wall for an hour between each fucking bite. ***WATCHING SIMS EAT AND SHIT IS NOT WHY I PLAY THE SIMS***. That’s just the part I (barely) tolerate so I can do the fun parts, like developing their relationships or working on their careers. ***NO ONE OTHER THAN MY SISTER IN LAW TAKES TWO HOURS TO SHOWER!!!*** Just fucking quit it. Make it faster. Get shit done.\n4. Multi-tasking is great, but it shouldn’t slow things down. Realism be damned, if I have no control over some dipshit missing link mother fucker coming over to talk to my sim while she’s eating, then I shouldn’t be punished for it by having the eating take long enough to be measured with a sun dial. If my sims are talking while they do homework, that shouldn’t slow down the process of finishing the homework. Again, fuck realism, I just want to not be pissed off.\n5. Stop being so ***GOD DAMN DUMB***, part 2. There’s a dinner table and a chair right next to you, why are you walking up two flights of stairs to sit on the bed to eat, you Neanderthal? There’s a kitchen sink right next to you, why are you journeying deep into the Amazon to wash your plate in the fountain of youth, you dumb fucking bucket of donkey shit?! Your date is sitting on that barstool right there, why are you climbing up to the fucking roof to start chatting with her, you backwards-pissing monkeyfucker?!\n6. Automatically change into normal clothes to go to work or school. I don’t know why my sims are all going to school in their (very inappropriate) pajamas or when that shit even started, but they ***needtofuckingquitit***.\n7. Back on “group conversations”. There needs to be an invite only thing. Like a pop up that says “Brent Hecking would like to join the conversation”, and the options should be “Sure, come on in, buddy” and “Fuck off”. I love group conversations because they allow more than two sims to build relationship at the same time, but the player should have control over this. The reason is because trying to get a group convo back down to just two sims ***IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE*** that takes eons to do.\n\n(Sigh) I feel better now. But seriously. I want more control over my sims, and I want them to be less hopelessly dumb when I just don’t feel like micro-managing a household of 8 sims.\n\nEDIT: Fixed some typos that were entirely the fault of my phone\'s autocorrect, which has become self-aware and is actively trying to destroy my life. It\'ll change ""baking the fucking cake"" to ""baking the fucking bake"", but then it\'ll completely ignore an obvious typo like ""establoshment"" and say ""NOPE! I don\'t know what to fucking do with _that shit_."" So if anyone from Apple is reading this, fuck you for a million reasons, but especially fuck you with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire for making autocorrect so _god damn infuriating_. You\'re one wrung higher on my shitlist than the knuckle-fuckers at Maxis.\n\nEDIT 2: Whichever weirdo gave this the ""wholesome"" award, you\'re my kind of asshole.\n\nEDIT 3: Here\'s another one:\n\n8. You know how if a sim gets struck by lightning twice, they die? So, umm... if my sim gets struck by lightning the first time... ***CAN YOU FUCKING TELL ME?!*** Why the game doesn\'t automatically switch focus to the sim that\'s literally going to die is beyond me. It\'s probably ***slightly*** more important than whatever else I was focusing on. ***THANKS***']"

One large reason for this is because it's so difficult to coordinate your Sims' interactions with them. For example, the baby is crying. Sim A is standing next to them. I tell Sim A to feed the baby. Instead they immediately wave their arms and complain that they can't path to the baby. The reason is that on the other side of the lot, Sim B has autonomously decided to feed the baby and are blocking Sim A. So I have to select Sim B, cancel their action, then go back to Sim A and choose theirs all over again.\n\nThis happens all the time, and is a big part of why it can be so frustrating to have baby sims in your house. And the solution is so simple: Just give priority to player selected actions over autonomous actions. So, in the above scenario, I tell Sim A to feed the baby. The game detects that Sim B is already on their way to do it. But Sim A's action was player selected and Sim B's was autonomous, so it should cancel Sim B's action and allow Sim A to carry out theirs.\n\nAs someone current raising Sim triplets, this little fix would improve my life immeasurably!\n\n(Also, while we're at it: 99% of the time you click on a baby Sim, you will be trying to do one of two things: Feed or Change Diaper. Both of these used to be on the front page of the action menu, accessible in just 1 click. They are now buried under More Choices... and then Baby Care... and so take 3 clicks to reach. This is incredibly frustrating. They should be moved back to the front page.)""]"

Batuu, My First Pet, Luxury Party) But what’s a pack that you just wouldn’t buy for whatever reason: doesn’t fit play style, CAS/bb not your style, don’t feel you need that feature, etc. \n\nFor me I just think adding the souls journey from Life and death just feels like too much work on top of all the stuff I already have to do for my sims aspirations, character values and careers. The pack looks cool and can see wanting to play with that feature but I know it would be too much for me. ', 'Cats & Dogs should become free like the base game.:\nI love TS4, it\'s one of my most played games ever, and I\'ve been playing it almost as long as it\'s been out. But given its lifespan, Cats & Dogs just doesn\'t measure up as a pack anymore. I think it\'s time that EA made it free to play permanently like the base game. At the very least, it needs a pack refresh if they\'re going to keep charging players to use it. Here\'s why:\n\n1. The textures. Oh my goodness, they are so outdated. The pets themselves are okay only because Simmers do the legwork of uploading incredible pets to the gallery. I will never not use a gallery animal if I want a specific breed in my family that actually looks like that breed. Also, have you looked at the build/buy textures? The cat trees and decor look ridiculous in my house filled with items from newer, more visually refined packs. It\'s even harder to match the items with the furniture, which brings me to my next point...\n\n2. WE NEVER GET NEW CONTENT. With Cats & Dogs locked behind a pack paywall, they never give us new items in SDX drops (mama I miss you), BG updates, or new packs. God forbid they give us a pets kit, we saw how that went over with My First Pets Stuff (and rightfully so!). We are stuck with outdated assets and outdated gameplay. Further, there are new breeds being recognized by the AKC and other world organizations that won\'t be added to the list of breeds in CAS because it never gets updated.\n\n3. We need more interactions and gameplay. Horse Ranch gave us fun horse training, and it made me sad that we\'ll never see anything like that for dogs. The dog training skill is SO lame, and you can\'t do much with it. I would love to see more dog sports, like Agility or Barn Hunt, but we won\'t. It\'s such a bummer! We got a few interactions with animals for infants but we know EA has more or less completely forgotten about pets in the game.\n\n4. If everyone had access to Cats & Dogs, it might encourage the team to go back and fix some bugs or make QOL changes to how it runs. Like I said, it badly needs a face-lift!\n\nThe solution: Make Cats & Dogs free like the base game. Everyone who wants it can have access. Then EA can start churning out kits for BB and CAS, they can justify the occasional SDX drops, they can make the odd Stuff Pack to add more gameplay. If people don\'t want to install Cats & Dogs, they don\'t have to, but it will give EA an easy way to promote more content and increase player engagement. It\'s been enough time since Cats & Dogs came out that I truly would not be bothered if it was made free.\n\n""But, mods!"" As we say on literally every other post like this, not everyone has access to mods. And not everyone wants to deal with mods and cc potentially needing updates down the road.\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant 🤣\n\nEdit: I\'m living for how controversial my hot take was LOL', 'Can they just go ahead and collapse My First Pet into Cats and Dogs already:\nIt\'s been seven years. With ""pack selection"" being a thing now, I only find myself more irritated that clothing for dogs and cats, dog and cat furniture, and *a single cohesive set of children\'s furniture* is strewn across two different packs, requiring me to select two packs just to get full access to a single gameplay or aesthetic ""theme"". I don\'t feel like this for any other combination of packs, even ones that have similar visual styles or complement each other mechanically. \n\nI wasn\'t even around for the initial backlash against MFP, but I can\'t imagine it would be *that* bad for them financially, this late into the game, to just merge what was clearly cut C&D content back into the main pack.

I didn\'t want to lose all her progress. \n\nIn a bid to keep all of my progress, I cheated the date into my family and had them plead with Grim. \nGrim was unimpressed. The urn appeared, and I had to have the random Sim pick it up and take it home. She puts down the gravestone by the front door and I call forth the ghost. I cheat the ghost into my family and send the rando on their merry way. I bought a wishing well, threw an obnoxiously large donation into it, requested life and it gives me an Angel fish.

He's ftm and she's mtf which is IMPORTANT CONTEXT, because he's the one who can get pregnant. Now. Caleb Vatore came knocking on their door one day, and in my brain there always has to be drama in my household, so I made my sim have an affair. The issue is, he. Got pregnant. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT IS AN ISSUE BECAUSE IT IS NOT HIS FIANCÉE'S BABY. Either way, he gave birth and the baby turned out not to be a vampire, and he has brown hair like the fiancée, so I decided to play it like. Whatever, she'll never know. Fast forward to like a week later, Caleb comes over to MEET HIS SON while the fiancée is at work, and I decide to start drama AGAIN AND THEY WOOHOO AGAIN. AND NOW HE'S PREGNANT AGAIN. And I'm worried what will happen if the baby is a vampire and. The only thing I can think of is to kill the fiancée??\n\nI guess the question hidden in this rant is: Am I insane for doing all this, or do all sims players do weird stuff constantly for the sake of interesting gameplay? 😭\n\nUpdate: The baby IS a vampire, and my sim took her to Caleb's house to meet him cause I've decided I don't want him in my sim's house 😭 She gets on great with Lilith, so I considered moving the baby in with them, but then she aged up into a toddler and she's SO much prettier than her older brother. Anyway my sim now has an almost permanent tense moodlet because I allowed him to become loyal after spending time with his fiancée. I've decided he'll tell her about his cheating on Winterfest!
