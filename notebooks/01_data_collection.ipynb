Yes you can now find it on the gallery. Gallery ID is CapitalCo. Turn on Advance>Include Custom Content. For some reason the game thinks it's modded, but I literally have no Build CC in my game right now.  \n2. Yes, I am using reshade. The one I am using is a personal file. I do have an older version of this personal file already uploaded to share. If you want it, please DM me and I will share the link with you.  \n3.Arch above the basketball court I made by adding a roof section there, dragging it over to hang above that area, and then thew some pillars down, then raised the pillars higher to meet the roof.  \n\\----  \nAnother weekend, another build!  \nWas playing the fourth gen of a family I made. A member of a second family the world, also fourth gen, proposed to her and they got married. Decided to branch them off and start them in their own house after the wedding ceremony. Moved them to the lot anD SHE DIED OF LAUGHTER. Of course her soul mate was heart broken, and after much thought, I decided to have him become a spell caster so he could eventually bring her back.

         "Sul Sul Simmers, We’ve received questions from players with concerns about the For Rent Expansion Pack and save file issues in The Sims 4. Today we’re sharing a detailed update on this, but here’s a quick TLDR; \n\n1. We’ve fixed 29 community reported issues on For Rent, and have 37 currently under investigation, with 11 requiring more info from players. 2 of those issues are related to save file concerns, with a combined total of 222 votes from players. We have a partial fix currently identified for the issue with the most votes, and will share updates as we have them. \n\n2. For save file issues more broadly, we’re currently aware of 6 issues that players correlate with save corruption. Our investigations show this is a complex situation; it’s not a single bug and given the huge variance in devices, setups, packs, and other factors, will continue to require thorough investigation by our team. We’re committed to tackling this and any detailed reports players can share will really help us progress. \n\nIf you’re experiencing a serious issue with your game, please use this post as an easy way to report the issue by answering the questions outlined: [https://forums.ea.com/blog/the-sims-game-info-hub-en/investigating-game-launch--save-file-issues/12500161](https://forums.ea.com/blog/the-sims-game-info-hub-en/investigating-game-launch--save-file-issues/12500161) \n\nYou can read the full update here: [https://forums.ea.com/blog/the-sims-game-info-hub-en/community-concerns-with-save-file-issues/12487619](https://forums.ea.com/blog/the-sims-game-info-hub-en/community-concerns-with-save-file-issues/12487619) \n\nWe’re also launching a new feedback section here on Discord [http://discord.gg/thesims](http://discord.gg/thesims) on August 27, 2025 at 10:00 AM PT so you can continue to help shape the future of The Sims. We’d love to hear your thoughts, take part in upcoming surveys, and join the conversation with our team and your fellow Simmers.",

         "The Bi-Weekly Build Challenge is led by community moderator [u/NoButterOnMyBread](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoButterOnMyBread/) and co-host, community volunteer [u/baar-ur](https://www.reddit.com/user/baar-ur/) (me!). Please direct any build challenge questions to either of us.\n_ _ _\n# Introduction for Newcomers\n\nEvery two weeks, the challenge will change. We’ll design a different house, community venue, or room interior, based on the provided theme, rules, and restrictions. Some challenges will have a monetary limit, such as under $20k, while others may have no limit and you can spend as many Simoleons as you’d like.\n\nThe challenge is not exclusive to The Sims 4; you may submit an entry using any Sims game, but we recommend The Sims 2 onward for the more in-depth building features. However, you may still submit entries for builds created in the original The Sims game.\n\nIf you would like to check out our past challenges, you can see a comprehensive list by searching [The Sims subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/thesims/search?q=bi-weekly+build+challenge&restrict_sr=on) under the Build Challenge flair.\n_ _ _\n# Bi-Weekly Build Challenge | Week 173: CAS - Kids\n\nIt doesn't matter whether your traits include Family-Oriented, Childish, or Hates Children. You can't deny that a lot of simmers include children in their play-throughs. We're bringing back Create-A-Sim challenges, and we're starting at the low end of the life-state scale. Show us some cute kids, and they had better be in adorable outfits, too! Bonus points for outfits appropriate to your weather, whether you're enjoying the perfect summer vacation weather, keeping warm during winter, escaping a heatwave, or watching the penguins play outside.\n\n_ _ _ \n# Build Guidelines\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* **One** entry per person.  \n* One child sim or a household with at least one child sim.\n* **No digital altering of photos (i.e., PhotoShop).**\n* CC is **allowed**.\n\nTo submit a valid entry, you must comment on this post and format your comment as such:\n\n***Your Reddit Username - Title of Submission - Sims Game (i.e., The Sims 4) - Link to photo***\n\nYou may also include your Gallery ID or a direct Gallery link if you’d like, but this is not required. Please note that entries submitted that do not follow this format will be disqualified and must be re-submitted.\n_ _ _\n# Important Dates\n\nDeadline: August 24th\n\nThe challenge closes at 10pm EST. This deadline is the cut-off for new submissions; this deadline is not an expectation of a new challenge. Winners will be announced when the next challenge goes live (within one week of the deadline).",

Tried to get him to blow out candle, everyone is celebrating over and over again, but he's still frozen... next thing I know, he looks like this- and his picture in the corner is all messed up. I saved and quit, so he wasn't in the process of aging up, and I didn't even get the pop up to add a trait or Aspiration, and now he looks like this-? He also has a random Aspiration (Playtime Captain) and only one trait that I've added (Self-Assured), no additional traits\n\nBtw, I have no mods or cc as I use Xbox",

So that's a 2^100 number of combinations. It's simply not possible to test that many packs.\n\nYou'll have the best experience with this game if you have no packs, or every single pack, because those two scenarios will be playtested the most. Obviously EA can't say that out loud, but it's true.\n\nI think this touches on a deeper issue, which is that releasing a video game with 2^100 versions is unreasonable. Expansion-based games have a shelf life and do not work as live service games. Eventually this jenga tower is gonna collapse.",
