For background, this is my 4th round with Esther and Zuleika. When I first played them they were attracted to each other and Grim, but seemed more set on each other long-term, both rolling the want to get married in round 2. In their 3rd round I wanted them to have a child so kept resetting for the \"bad\" outcome from the Wishing Well, that being their ghost daughter Skye. \\n\\n  \\nI loaded in for round 4 today and saw Zuleika had the want to have a child, so I thought it\\'d just check with MCCC to see if it\\'s possible as ghosts and...well. I\\'m truly baffled. I mean I\\'m not complaining, but I\\'m beyond confused here. As you can see there\\'s no options to progress, change or end the pregnancy. I have any MCCC and neighbourhood stories settings that could have done this switched off. I do play with WW so that seems like the only other culprit, but Grim has always been very careful in that regard... \\n\\n  \\nI plan on reviving Skye at some point so she can grow up and keep up with her friends while they go through high school, and had considered doing the same with Zuleika so she could have that baby. Don\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m very happy for them, just very, ***very*** confused!!', 'My sims just had a kid but turns out my sim is NOT the father :\\nMy sim on the left was with the girl on the right but they didnt live together, after I noticed she is pregnant i added her to my house but she gave birth a day ago and the baby is black 😭?? Im so confused because the kid is a vampire just like my sim but when you look at his genealogical tree he doesnt even have a father, I have no idea what to do with him now ', 'Cats & Dogs should become free like the base game.:\\nI love TS4, it\\'s one of my most played games ever, and I\\'ve been playing it almost as long as it\\'s been out. But given its lifespan, Cats & Dogs just doesn\\'t measure up as a pack anymore. I think it\\'s time that EA made it free to play permanently like the base game. At the very least, it needs a pack refresh if they\\'re going to keep charging players to use it. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n1. The textures. Oh my goodness, they are so outdated. The pets themselves are okay only because Simmers do the legwork of uploading incredible pets to the gallery. I will never not use a gallery animal if I want a specific breed in my family that actually looks like that breed. Also, have you looked at the build/buy textures? The cat trees and decor look ridiculous in my house filled with items from newer, more visually refined packs. It\\'s even harder to match the items with the furniture, which brings me to my next point...\\n\\n2. WE NEVER GET NEW CONTENT. With Cats & Dogs locked behind a pack paywall, they never give us new items in SDX drops (mama I miss you), BG updates, or new packs. God forbid they give us a pets kit, we saw how that went over with My First Pets Stuff (and rightfully so!). We are stuck with outdated assets and outdated gameplay. Further, there are new breeds being recognized by the AKC and other world organizations that won\\'t be added to the list of breeds in CAS because it never gets updated.\\n\\n3. We need more interactions and gameplay. Horse Ranch gave us fun horse training, and it made me sad that we\\'ll never see anything like that for dogs. The dog training skill is SO lame, and you can\\'t do much with it. I would love to see more dog sports, like Agility or Barn Hunt, but we won\\'t. It\\'s such a bummer! We got a few interactions with animals for infants but we know EA has more or less completely forgotten about pets in the game.\\n\\n4. If everyone had access to Cats & Dogs, it might encourage the team to go back and fix some bugs or make QOL changes to how it runs. Like I said, it badly needs a face-lift!\\n\\nThe solution: Make Cats & Dogs free like the base game. Everyone who wants it can have access. Then EA can start churning out kits for BB and CAS, they can justify the occasional SDX drops, they can make the odd Stuff Pack to add more gameplay. If people don\\'t want to install Cats & Dogs, they don\\'t have to, but it will give EA an easy way to promote more content and increase player engagement. It\\'s been enough time since Cats & Dogs came out that I truly would not be bothered if it was made free.\\n\\n\"But, mods!\" As we say on literally every other post like this, not everyone has access to mods. And not everyone wants to deal with mods and cc potentially needing updates down the road.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant 🤣\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m living for how controversial my hot take was LOL']"

I'm pretty new to reddit so this has probably been posted before.\\n\\nI've been playing Sims 4 with mods for a long time now and I've always been able to play the game with mods with very little to no issue. But for some reason, after installing the new Wicked Perversions update, I can't play the game in live mode anymore. When I load up my save file, it opens up on the Worlds Map and whenever I try to play my household (or even any household), I just get rerouted back to the Worlds Map again.\\n\\nI've tried deleting Wicked Perversions and even doing the 50/50 method to check which of my mods are causing the error, but neither has worked. I've also tried deleting cache files (GameVersion.txt, Options.ini, localthumbcache.package, and Resource.cfg in the mods folder) since I saw a similar post that had this as the solution. \\n\\nSo far, the only thing that seems to work was disabling script mods (but not cc). I was able to play in live mode and load my household after this, but obviously most of my mods don't really work anymore.\\n\\nI'm open to trying anything at this point, so if any of you have any suggestions, I'd really appreciate it.\", 'Loading Lot Kicks Me Back to World Screen:\\nHi, I was wondering if anyone has any experience or ideas about this problem I can’t seem to solve please – basically, whenever I try to enter build mode on any lot, or load any household, the game kicks me back to the world screen with the message: “The game failed to load. Error code: 122:dd7d01fa:aab9abe8. It is recommended that you relaunch the game.”\\n\\nWhat I’ve already tried:\\n\\n* The 50/50 test (twice!) with my mods/CC. Each time I carefully narrowed down to “safe” mods/CC, and everything worked fine when testing them in smaller groups. But when I put all those “ok” files back together in the Mods folder, the build mode error comes back again.\\xa0\\n* Sims 4 Mod Manager to update all mods/CC\\xa0\\n* TwistedMexi’s Better Exceptions mod, but whenever the error happens the Critical Exception report just stays stuck on ‘scanning’ forever and never generates properly.\\xa0\\n* Cleared EA App cache and Sims 4 cache (localthumbcache, cache folders, etc.).\\xa0\\n* Repaired the game in the EA App.\\xa0\\n\\nAt this point I’m at my wits end! The game works fine mod-free, and I can’t seem to isolate one single culprit mod because it only breaks when the “ok” mods are all together. I’m wondering if maybe it’s some kind of conflict between two or more mods/CC?\\xa0\\n\\nAny help, ideas, or even just things I might not have thought to try would mean so much. Thank you in advance for your time (and patience) 🙏 I really appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and help!']"

I\\'m fine with removing the clutter in build mode if I had to earn it some other way, but instead I actually *make* money by removing that stuff.  \\nSome sort of functionality where removing stuff actually costs money (you know, like in real life) would be a cool solution, since most \"worn down\" decorations can\\'t be fixed via gameplay and some can\\'t even be interacted with in live mode, so I doubt anyone ever bothered to make a mod for unhinged people like me.\\n\\nI\\'d also love if fixing broken stuff cost money on top of time.

Only issue is I spent *HOURS* making a few sims before I realized that certain features just werent linking. Clothes and hair were fine, but if I had to adjust any facial features the changes wouldnt register between fairy form and their disguise. I noticed the option to link everything but clicking it does nothing. \\n\\nThen, I tried to just manually adjust what didn't copy, but for whatever reason it *was* copying, just not correctly. Adjusting the lip shape in the fairy form would also adjust it in the disguise, but the actual shape wouldn't end up the same. I'd get the fairy form exactly how I want it, just to go back to the disguse and see everything was deformed. Same thing would happen by adjusting the disguise then looking back at the fairy form. I got frustrated and just closed the game deciding I'd try again next time I play.  \\n\\nIs this just a weird bug or am I mistaken in how linking between forms is supposed to work?

So I make the wedding,\\n\\nFirst mistake, did it at my house somehow. But okay whatever, Heard wedding stories gotten fixed (from where, idk but mine was buggy as heck) but I’ll make it work. I invite everyone over, yet no one is in the proper attire. Okay whatever. Can handle.  My sims get married, okay now I want to slow dance. \\n\\nI kept clicking but nothing. All of a sudden fire breaks out. Just randomly too. There’s no fire places or any technology near that area. \\n\\nSecond mistake, calling the fire department. First it took nine tries, then they are like “We’re coming over there right now” by then three people have died. So now I’m scared for my generation heir. I just had a baby and I really don’t want everyone to die. By now my baby is STRAVING and I cannot feed her because my sims can’t do anything. Fire department gets there GREATTT, nope not great. They stand outside freaking out. I called them again and they say their are already there BUT THEY ARENT DOING ANYTHING. NOW TWO MORE PEOPLE ARE DOWN. they get inside and I get hopefully, nope they start making drinks at the bar across from the fire. \\n\\nThird mistake, thinking that only five people will die. Fire finally got put out, but what cost? Insurance gave me 1,200. But all together it was 4,000 to fix. My couch got burn, rug, dinning room table, desk and chair, another rug, and photos from the two previous generations. But sadly almost all my guest died. Ten people died, six of them I got to make like a bowling pin area. My sister, mom, dad, two brothers, best friend, my husband mom and dad, a random towny that just showed up and my gen one heir grandma. So both of our families were wiped out in a matter of five minutes? \\n\\nAnd this should be on me, because to be fair it was four am and I should’ve really been in bed. Now the only people my sims know are her exs and their only child who somehow didn’t get taken away from starvation. And it ruined like all the story line I had going for them.

I was waiting for a perfect remake of sims 2 with open world like sims 3, and many other features, and graphics. an immersive gameplay where everything matters, everything is important, that they are not just puppets. \\n\\ninstead, we got bland, tasteless, lifeless, even useless sims 4. \\nugly graphics even for the time, a bland gameplay, and no real purpose. everything is boring. \\nnothing really matters. the emotions, which was announced as a big feature, does not affect a lot the gameplay. \\nonly 3 traits that does not affects the gameplays either, and a life goal/ambition system that is absolutely bland compared to the sims 2 and 3.\\nthey add more and more and more features with the 500 packs that they sell u for 40€, that are as useless and bland. sims are just useless puppets that have no real purpose. which is very sad, for a life simulator. \\n\\nwe were announced Project rene, but it’s been 1 year since we had any updates and news about this game. i’m losing hope. \\n\\nthe sims franchise will die if they don’t do anything. \\n\\n what do you think? do you agree? ', 'Soooo, given that EA has confirmed we’re not getting the Sims 5… what now for the series?:\\nSo this was something I was thinking about, as it stands, EA obv isn\\'t planning a direct successor to the Sims 4, instead basically focusing on spin offs (most of which seem to be mobile games, which yes I get are very profitable but don\\'t really fill the same niche as the traditional Sims games at all IMO). And so with this news, I was thinking, where does that leave the Sims 4, and the Sims generally?\\n\\nNow obviously, the Sims isn’t quite in the position it used to be in, where it was the only game like it on the market, so the user just kinda had to put up with whatever. There are various competitors popping up which COULD potentially knock the Sims off its throne, or at least take a decent market share away from the brand!\\n\\nI mean, in my opinion, there are basically a few things the Sims 4 could do, they could either go a “ship of thesis” route where most of the games internals are repaired and modernised (leaving no-very little remnants of the original game, hense the analogy), or they could keep things mostly as they are (basically an 11 year old game held together by duct tape and hope) and hope for the best.\\n\\nOn one hand, IF they were to choose to go the “ship of thesis” route, it\\'d be quite a bit of work, given they\\'d effectively be rewriting very large portions of the game (arguably effectively creating a new game). However, in the long term, it might just be what’s best for both the health of the game (and therefore EA’s profits) and the playerbase (who EA are heavily reliant on). \\n\\nOriginally, the Sims 4 was planned to be an always-online multiplayer-ish game, but when SimCity (2013) failed as hard as it did, EA pivoted and hastily retooled the game into a single-player game, which, of course, caused a bunch of issues. And while SOME of these issues have been remedied over the years, many are still present, and NGL, it\\'s just hard to build your supposedly definitive Sims game on such rocky foundations. \\n\\nRewriting large parts of the game could solve this; they\\'d be replacing all the problematic, hacky parts of the code base, and they could even rewrite the game into something based on what EA specifically wants it to be NOW, a very long-term Sims base game to sell DLC from, optimised for modern hardware. \\n\\nWho knows, with such rewrites, EA may finally be able to implement some features that the fanbase has been asking for but which were previously impossible, such as greater modding capabilities (maybe even stuff like Create-a-World), and they could EVEN try to implement arguably the biggest selling point one of their main competitors has over them, an open world (though that could be a slight reach haha). \\n\\nSo while yes, it would be a lot of work for EA to rewrite and optimise the Sims 4 for modern systems (perhaps such a rewrite could see the game rebranded to just simply \"the Sims\"), doing so could potentially allow EA to ensure that their competiton are unable to seriously challenge them in the life sim market.\\n\\nOn the other hand, EA could simply keep doing what they are doing now, continuing to release new DLCs and neglecting areas of the game in need of optimisation and bugfixes. By doing this, they\\'d largely be relying on brand loyalty and stuff like influencer advertising. However... I kinda feel like... I mean, influencer advertising isn\\'t SUPER expensive, and companies like Krafton can also afford to promote their game this way. So really, they\\'re kinda just relying on the brand loyalty people have for the Sims, and hoping that the other competitors don\\'t get too popular. \\n\\nI feel that for EA, this is kinda a risky strategy. It MIGHT work; the other main competitors may simply fail to gain significant traction, and the Sims gets to maintain its profitable position at the top without EA having to expend the effort to fix the game. If that happens, EA wins! HOWEVER, if either one of the new Sims competitors ends up getting good, good enough to start taking customers away from the Sims, then EA and Maxis could face a situation similar to that of Cities: Skylines and SimCity, which would probably be disastrous for EA, given how important the Sims brand is for them.\\n\\nBut yeah, those were just my silly thoughts, obviously, I\\'m just kinda spitballing here, I\\'d love to hear your thoughts in the comments though, thanks a bunch for reading!', 'I’m pissed off, and now I have a list of demands for the next Sims game:\\nDisclaimer: this post is slightly tongue-in-cheek, but does convey my thoughts on what I think should be prioritized for The Sims 5, assuming it gets made. Also, this post will be _laden_ with profanity - you’ve been warned\\n\\nSomething that has remained a constant throughout the Sims series is that Sims do all kinds of stupid shit to _piss you off_. The Sims 4 is better about this in some regards, but worse in others. This all became very clear to me during a bit of a marathon Sims 4 session yesterday, playing a family that consisted of two married sims and their three pairs of twins, where I became more and more frustrated throughout the day. Apologies to my neighbors, who probably now think I’m verbally abusing a mute person who lives with me as they sporadically hear me scream things like “NO! Put down the fucking bowl NOW and go to the fucking bathroom, you stupid cunt!”\\n\\nAs a result, I now have an official list of demands for Sims 5. It doesn’t include cars, open world, or any of that crap. It simply includes ways for sims to not piss me off so fucking much.\\n\\nBtw, this is focused on ways the Sims 4 pisses me off, but before you go smugly saying “tHiS iS wHy I wEnT bAcK 2 tHe SiMs 3”, just know that I will _glady_ spell out the fucking _LITANY_ of ways that The Sims 3 used to piss me off. Try me, stans. 🤣\\n\\nWithout further ado, my list of demands for a future Sims game:\\n\\n1. If I tell you to do something, do it ***NOW!!!*** Not 5 sim minutes from now. Not after you’re done with the chat animation. NOW!! Fucking NOW NOW NOW. I know it’s really important to _you_ that you finish your next bite of cereal, but it’s more important to _ME_ that you not ***SHIT YOURSELF***. In other words, sims should be more responsive and stop an activity immediately if the player has cancelled that action. It’s not unrealistic to do - in real life it’s a thing you can do to say “Hold that thought, Bob, I need to go to the bathroom before I shit myself.” It’s not rude, it’s just good manners to not shit yourself.\\n2. Stop being so ***GOD DAMN DUMB***. We need better AI. It doesn’t have to be perfect - I’m totally fine with my stupid sims passing out because they didn’t get enough sleep. What I can’t fucking stand is when they’re so irredeemably stupid that it results in what I’m lovingly referring to as “Nightmare morning”. It’s Saturday morning, the last pair of twins is ready to age up. So mom baked them a birthday cake. This takes _hours_ because all the teenagers in the house are all trying to cook ***for some fucking reason*** despite that there are already two excellent-quality meals ready for them on the counter, and so mom can’t reach the oven to finish the cake. Cue several minutes of all my sims playing hot potato with this bowl of cake dough as I try to cancel their actions one by one. This is already fucking infuriating, but then one of them decides to try to grill something, but they have no cooking skill so they set the grill on fire, and now everyone stops what they’re doing to look at the fire, which is on the other side of the fucking lot. Bright side, now the oven is clear, so mom can ***finally finish baking the fucking cake***. Finally, we get some candles on that bad boy, and mom’s close to her birthday, so I decide to kill three birthdays with one cake. Mom blows out the candles, but then instead of aging up, _she teleports outside of the house_. Okay let’s try again. Same thing. I do reset sim, and this time it works. I proceed to do “reset sim” on each of the twins before having them blow out the candles, though it takes a while, because they have both wandered off to the edge of the lot which is a big deal because it’s one of those huge Windenburg lots. In summary, better AI for autonomy. The autonomy is better than in previous games but it’s still really bad.\\n3. Faster eating. Faster shitting. Faster showering. I’m so fucking sick of this shit, I don’t know why we’re all so okay with it taking a fucking month for a sim to eat a fucking bowl of cereal, sitting there like a grinning little cunt staring at the fucking wall for an hour between each fucking bite. ***WATCHING SIMS EAT AND SHIT IS NOT WHY I PLAY THE SIMS***. That’s just the part I (barely) tolerate so I can do the fun parts, like developing their relationships or working on their careers. ***NO ONE OTHER THAN MY SISTER IN LAW TAKES TWO HOURS TO SHOWER!!!*** Just fucking quit it. Make it faster. Get shit done.\\n4. Multi-tasking is great, but it shouldn’t slow things down. Realism be damned, if I have no control over some dipshit missing link mother fucker coming over to talk to my sim while she’s eating, then I shouldn’t be punished for it by having the eating take long enough to be measured with a sun dial. If my sims are talking while they do homework, that shouldn’t slow down the process of finishing the homework. Again, fuck realism, I just want to not be pissed off.\\n5. Stop being so ***GOD DAMN DUMB***, part 2. There’s a dinner table and a chair right next to you, why are you walking up two flights of stairs to sit on the bed to eat, you Neanderthal? There’s a kitchen sink right next to you, why are you journeying deep into the Amazon to wash your plate in the fountain of youth, you dumb fucking bucket of donkey shit?! Your date is sitting on that barstool right there, why are you climbing up to the fucking roof to start chatting with her, you backwards-pissing monkeyfucker?!\\n6. Automatically change into normal clothes to go to work or school. I don’t know why my sims are all going to school in their (very inappropriate) pajamas or when that shit even started, but they ***needtofuckingquitit***.\\n7. Back on “group conversations”. There needs to be an invite only thing. Like a pop up that says “Brent Hecking would like to join the conversation”, and the options should be “Sure, come on in, buddy” and “Fuck off”. I love group conversations because they allow more than two sims to build relationship at the same time, but the player should have control over this. The reason is because trying to get a group convo back down to just two sims ***IS A FUCKING NIGHTMARE*** that takes eons to do.\\n\\n(Sigh) I feel better now. But seriously. I want more control over my sims, and I want them to be less hopelessly dumb when I just don’t feel like micro-managing a household of 8 sims.\\n\\nEDIT: Fixed some typos that were entirely the fault of my phone\\'s autocorrect, which has become self-aware and is actively trying to destroy my life. It\\'ll change \"baking the fucking cake\" to \"baking the fucking bake\", but then it\\'ll completely ignore an obvious typo like \"establoshment\" and say \"NOPE! I don\\'t know what to fucking do with _that shit_.\" So if anyone from Apple is reading this, fuck you for a million reasons, but especially fuck you with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire for making autocorrect so _god damn infuriating_. You\\'re one wrung higher on my shitlist than the knuckle-fuckers at Maxis.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Whichever weirdo gave this the \"wholesome\" award, you\\'re my kind of asshole.\\n\\nEDIT 3: Here\\'s another one:\\n\\n8. You know how if a sim gets struck by lightning twice, they die? So, umm... if my sim gets struck by lightning the first time... ***CAN YOU FUCKING TELL ME?!*** Why the game doesn\\'t automatically switch focus to the sim that\\'s literally going to die is beyond me. It\\'s probably ***slightly*** more important than whatever else I was focusing on. ***THANKS***']"

HOW DO I GET HIM OUT?!:\\nLil bit of info, I’m playing the Sims 4 on a desktop. My game is fully updated, as are all my mods. \\n\\nAlexander Goth came into my restaurant with his parents as a customer like 8 in game days ago. They got their food. They ate. They left. But they didn’t take their kid with them. Instead he just stayed there. After a few days of sitting in my diner with no way to care for his needs, I got the notification that child services was taking him away. I thought that would fix things. It did not. And now, I can’t just switch to the Goth family and make him go home, because after being taken away, he technically isn’t a family member. It’s like the game doesn’t recognize his existence but he’s still there. His needs don’t decay (from what I can tell, anyway. He never appears filthy, and the exclamation bubbles never appear to indicate anything he needs) but he can still interact with things and talk to my sims. He talks to them so much, in fact, that they neglect their needs to chitchat. I’ve tried using cheats to kill him, being mean to him to make him want to leave, etc. But I guess he thinks this is home now. \\n\\nHow do I make him realize that this is not, in fact, his home, and get him out for good? ', \"Simple suggestion for the Sims Team that would improve babies, infants, and toddlers 1 million percent!:\\nAs we all know, babies, infants and toddlers can be really annoying to play. One large reason for this is because it's so difficult to coordinate your Sims' interactions with them. For example, the baby is crying. Sim A is standing next to them. I tell Sim A to feed the baby. Instead they immediately wave their arms and complain that they can't path to the baby. The reason is that on the other side of the lot, Sim B has autonomously decided to feed the baby and are blocking Sim A. So I have to select Sim B, cancel their action, then go back to Sim A and choose theirs all over again.\\n\\nThis happens all the time, and is a big part of why it can be so frustrating to have baby sims in your house. And the solution is so simple: Just give priority to player selected actions over autonomous actions. So, in the above scenario, I tell Sim A to feed the baby. The game detects that Sim B is already on their way to do it. But Sim A's action was player selected and Sim B's was autonomous, so it should cancel Sim B's action and allow Sim A to carry out theirs.\\n\\nAs someone current raising Sim triplets, this little fix would improve my life immeasurably!\\n\\n(Also, while we're at it: 99% of the time you click on a baby Sim, you will be trying to do one of two things: Feed or Change Diaper. Both of these used to be on the front page of the action menu, accessible in just 1 click. They are now buried under More Choices... and then Baby Care... and so take 3 clicks to reach. This is incredibly frustrating. They should be moved back to the front page.)\"]"

I assume the ghost skill tree will be accessible in the same means as the trees for the other occults, which is through a button in a sims needs tab. But then if that's the case what happens to the skill tree of the other occults? Will there be an option to choose which skill tree you wish to access when you want to? Also how would the needs tab even look like in the case of vampires who's bladder need are completely non-existent and have their hunger and energy needs are replaced with Thirst and Vampire Energy?

During that time, she did 2 terms of university (I like to get a kick start on careers like Astronaut that are a lot of work), she aged up from a teen to a young adult, she learned a ton of skills and she went on several dates to try and find her significant other. At no point did I save. \\n\\nEventually, I sent her on a blind date just for the fun. She left home feeling confident, but as soon as she stepped into the venue she got hysterical. Fatally hysterical. Within 5 seconds of arrival, she was dying of laughter. \\n\\nI panicked, of course. I knew I had at least 2 hours of gameplay under my belt with no saves. I really didn\\'t want to lose that. Normally if a Not So Berry Heir dies, I\\'d be able to switch to a sibling - but yellow gen doesn\\'t have siblings as Rose gen can only have one child. I didn\\'t want to lose all her progress. \\n\\nIn a bid to keep all of my progress, I cheated the date into my family and had them plead with Grim. \\nGrim was unimpressed. The urn appeared, and I had to have the random Sim pick it up and take it home. She puts down the gravestone by the front door and I call forth the ghost. I cheat the ghost into my family and send the rando on their merry way. I bought a wishing well, threw an obnoxiously large donation into it, requested life and it gives me an Angel fish. I delete the well in a fit of rage. I don\\'t have the skill or the ingredients to make ambrosia! \\nThen I remember the gallery, and download myself a tiny room with a lovely dining setup and two portions of ambrosia. One of them goes straight into my family inventory to avoid this situation happening again. My Sim eats the ambrosia, comes back to life, and I rejoice. \\n\\n*I save.*\\n\\nMy Sim has nothing in the career panel. It\\'s been less than the time between classes, but her university heard she was dead and kicked her corpse straight out. OK, I think, she can re-enroll and complete her final term. \\n*Is it just me that didn\\'t know the university won\\'t remember your progress?*\\nI was suddenly faced with the fact that she would have to redo both terms she finished as well as the third she hadn\\'t done yet. I categorically refused to do this. At this point I could have cut my losses except I\\'d saved the second she came back to life. I decided she could just work her way up the career from the bottom. University is way too much work to do twice. \\nIt seems like a serious oversight to me that Sims can\\'t take their existing credits and finish their degree. \\n\\nAnyway, don\\'t be me.

I know they could, the business activities work almost exactly like the clubs from get together and the get together clubs have use the jump platform as a club activity, but for some reason it's not in the small business activites panel, and I know it's not a cross-pack thing, like they forgot to add cross pack compatability, because i also have backyard stuff and one of the possible activities is to use the slip and slide thing. is there any way I could make them use the jump platform?\", \"Anyone else annoyed by how bad plantsims are to play?:\\nI'm not even gonna get into the fact that being a plantsim is only temporary, or that you can't change your hair or skin color, or lack of any significant gameplay because those are all fixable by mods. \\n\\nWhat annoys me the most is the water motive.
